# AWS ECS Experiments
#

5/27/24: These notes are from 2015 while I worked at WeaveWorks (sadly shutdown now), and very out of date. Moved to an archive. 

The details for these scripts come from the [(AWS EC2 Container Service Developer Guides)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html),please refer there for more details.

The scripts here do a basic setup of some AWS ECS instances using the Amazon ECS AMI.

Feel free to use at your own risk, these are not sanity checked for production.
